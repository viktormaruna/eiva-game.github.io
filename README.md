===================

We have designed a game based on a popular boardgame Dixit. You are either a storyteller, or a common player and you are playing along with other friends to guess the storyteller's card based on a story he has written about it. Cards in our game are represented by popular funny moving pictures and the story can be enhanced with the help of meme faces. As you play, you can collect achievements and rating. Each game rewards you with points that calculate your rating, and its only up to you whether you end up in the top 10. You are also able to connect to the game using your facebook account and share pictures about the things you experience in the game.

Using this game we are able to collect relevant metadata about the pictures, that can be later used in several other projects, for example in a search system. We are efficiently tagging pictures using the crowdsourcing and therefore solving otherwise hardly solvable problem, if we didn't use the human interaction. Obviously the info that comes from the game has to be processed, which we are taking care of.

Another interesting feature is the multiplatforming. You are able to play the game on almost all popular devices of today. Smart devices as phones and tablets with Android and iOS, desktop platform support for Windows and Mac. Additionally you are able to play the game directly in your webbrowser, either from our site in a webplayer or as a facebook game.
